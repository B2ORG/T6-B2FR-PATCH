Ready to use patches can be found in `Compiled` directory.
Source code for every given patch can be found in `Raw` directory.
For competitive 0 controversy games i suggest using `First Room Fix V4.gsc` or `First Room Fix V5.gsc` from `Compiled`.
At this point in time disregard all versions below 4, as they don't fix the tickrate problem. All games on Pluto past January 21st played on any First Room fix below 4 will be considered invalid. Version 5 is recommended.
