All the patches are in the `V4 Compiled` folder.
Go into `V4 Compiled` folder for basic version of the patch as well as all patches compiled for other players.
For competitive 0 controversy games i suggest using `First Room Fix V4.gsc` from `V4 Compiled`.
At this point in time disregard all versions below 4, as they don't fix the tickrate problem. All games on Pluto past January 21st played on any First Room fix below 4 will be considered invalid.
