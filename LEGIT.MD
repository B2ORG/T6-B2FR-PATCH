# Network Frame

I will not be going deep into how and why Network Frame drama even came to be. But regarding First Room Fix, initial version of the fix has been implemented in Version 4, and remained unchaged until Version 5.2

That initial version of the fix was incorrect.

| VERSION | LEGIT - SOLO | LEGIT - COOP |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| V3 & NO PATCH | NO | YES |
| V4 & V5.0 & V5.1 | YES | NO |
| V5.2+ | YES | YES |

# Permaperks

There is a flaw somewhere in the permaperk logic, that's causing the system to malfunction under certain conditions, if the perks are artificially awarded in the same game. Is seems to be related to fast restarts / map restarts.

There's been few versions of the system, but up until version 6, the system was more or less malfunctioning

| VERSION | RISK - SOLO | RISK - COOP |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| V4 | HIGH | HIGH |
| V5.0 - V5.5 | HIGH | HIGH |
| V5.6 | LOW | HIGH |
| V5.7 | ZERO (system disabled) | ZERO (system disabled) |
| V6 | VERY LOW | VERY LOW |
